# Ecoway-Service

Backend system of our data analysis system, related to **LELLO**.

### Project Overview

Our project aims to analyze data related to trash disposal in buildings. The project will collect data on the amount and type of trash generated by each building, the frequency of trash pickup, and any associated costs. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in the data that can help building managers optimize their trash disposal systems and reduce costs.

### Collaborating with the Project

To collaborate on the project and make changes to the code, we use Git as our version control system. The recommended workflow for making changes to the code is as follows:

1. Create a new branch: Before making any changes to the codebase, create a new branch with a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your changes. This can be done using the command ```git checkout -b new-branch-name```.
1. Make changes: Make the desired changes to the codebase on your local machine.
1. Commit changes: Once you have made changes, commit them to your branch using the command ```git commit -m "Commit message"```.
1. Push changes to your branch: Push your changes to your branch using the command ```git push origin new-branch-name```.
1. Open a pull request: Once you have pushed your changes to your branch, open a pull request (PR) on GitHub. A PR is a request to merge your changes from your branch into the main branch. Make sure to add a descriptive title and description to your PR to explain the changes you have made.
1. Review and merge changes: The project maintainer(s) will review your changes and either request changes or approve and merge them into the main branch.

By following this workflow, collaborators can safely make changes to the codebase without directly modifying the main branch, reducing the risk of conflicts and unintended consequences.
